      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the project repository, Next.js/React/TypeScript initialization, GitHub Actions configuration, Vercel and Supabase deployment, Sentry and Supabase Analytics integration, and dependency pinning into discrete subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple tools and integrations (frontend, backend, CI/CD, monitoring, analytics, and dependency management). Each step requires configuration and verification, making it moderately complex and suitable for at least six subtasks."
